First walkthrough about threading uses bind, 
passes structure, 
run twice once non threaded once threaded,
know thread join and accumulate, final answer adds up threads

2nd walkthrough
Uses transform,
2 transforms - transform (x.begin(), x.end(), out.begin(), fn) (simple form)
	     - transform with they as well
best to write a program to play around with it.

in the algorthim notes 

3rd questions are a bunch of short questions.
a) What are benifits using a vector and what are the benifits of a list
b) What are emplace back and emplace front
c) describe one advantage of a function object vs a lambda
	-object can have member functions/ constructors
	-lambda's can have a capture
4th
How to print out a vector vector string with a range based for

5th
What are smart pointers?
-smart pointers are things that automatically call delete when the run out of scope.

6th

Write some code that uses compositions, associations, aggregations
-How to write a composite class (like stations from workshop) maybe an addRoom/House file in attic have to check
-Might be another example with clubs and students in attic. Maybe Motor and car
-Ducks in a pond is another example of aggregation
